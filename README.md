# dywy

An iterative wedding planning tool: guests receive a personal invitation (QR code + magic-link
sign-in) to RSVP, choose a meal, and pick a song for the wedding playlist, while the couple
manages everything from a Google-authenticated backoffice. The scope grows iteratively, starting
with guest management.

Fullstack app: Kotlin/Spring Boot backend (`backend/`) + Vue 3/TypeScript frontend (`frontend/`) —
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full stack and conventions.

## Security notes

- Never commit `.env` production secrets; keep all credentials in Render secret environment
  variables.
- Guest self-service and backoffice access are two independent security models — see the
  [guest magic-link security notes](docs/guest-magic-link-security.md) and the
  [backoffice permissions guide](docs/backoffice-read-only-permissions.md).
- For IP-based protections (rate limiting), do not trust forwarded headers unless your
  ingress/proxy sanitizes them.
