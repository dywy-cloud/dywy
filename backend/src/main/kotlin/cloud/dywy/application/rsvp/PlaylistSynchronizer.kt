/**
 * Pushes a guest's chosen song to the shared wedding playlist and records that it is now synced, and
 * removes a track once no guest chooses it anymore.
 *
 * De-duplication is derived from the RSVP answers: if the track is already on the playlist (another
 * guest synced it) it is not added again, only flagged as synced for this guest. The song is flagged
 * as synced only once the provider confirms it, so a failed sync stays pending for the reconciler to
 * retry.
 *
 * The check-then-act (is-on-playlist then add, is-still-chosen then remove) is not atomic on its own,
 * so concurrent submissions and reconciliations for the same track could otherwise add duplicates or
 * let a removal race an addition. Each track is therefore guarded by its own lock, serialising add and
 * remove for the same [deezerId][SongChoice.deezerId] while leaving unrelated tracks parallel. The app
 * runs as a single instance (see render.yaml), so an in-process lock is sufficient; a multi-instance
 * deployment would need a shared lock (e.g. a Postgres advisory lock) instead.
 *
 * Best-effort: any provider failure is logged and swallowed so it can never fail the guest's RSVP.
