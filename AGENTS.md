# Project Instructions

Code only, no explanation
Bullets over paragraphs. No explanations unless asked

This is a fullstack project.

## General Guidelines

- **Project Goal**: The application is an iterative wedding planning tool designed to help manage wedding preparations,
  starting with guest management. Note: This goal is evolving as we work iteratively.
- **Workflow**: After any code modification, ensure you stage the affected files using `git add`. When starting to work on a new issue you should update the main branch and create a new branch for your work. You should never commit or push work.
- **Branch naming convention**: Use the format `feat/#<issue-number><short-description>` for new features and `fix/#<issue-number><short-description>` for bug fixes.
- **Versioning rule**: For every issue (frontend, backend, or fullstack), bump and keep aligned both application versions before staging changes: `frontend/package.json` and `backend/build.gradle.kts`.
- **GitHub access**: You may read GitHub via `curl` against the public REST API (anonymous, no token) to fetch issue/PR details, e.g. `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/dywy-cloud/dywy/issues/<number>`.
- **Craft principles**:
  - **KISS**: prefer the simplest implementation that satisfies the scope; avoid unnecessary abstraction, indirection, or overly clever code.
  - **YAGNI**: implement only what is required by the current issue scope; do not add speculative features, extension points, or premature generalization.


## Backend
- If java is not found (JDK is managed via SDKMAN on this machine):
  - `export JAVA_HOME="$HOME/.sdkman/candidates/java/current"`
  - `export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`
  - Fallback if a system JDK is installed instead: `export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-25.jdk/Contents/Home"`
- All backend code is located in the `backend` directory.
- **Architecture**: Follows a DDD/Clean Architecture pattern with `api`, `application`, `domain`, and `infrastructure`
  packages. The `api` layer uses functional routing (Kotlin DSL).
  - Current API modules include guest endpoints in `backend/src/main/kotlin/me/elgregos/theweddingplan/api/guest` and auth endpoints in `backend/src/main/kotlin/me/elgregos/theweddingplan/api/auth`.
- **Technologies**: Kotlin, Spring Boot, Gradle, Exposed (for SQL), Liquibase (for DB migrations), and PostgreSQL.
- **Build & Test Commands**:
  - Run unit tests: `./gradlew test`
  - Run integration tests: `./gradlew integrationTest`
  - Run full verification (includes integration tests): `./gradlew check`
- **Testing**:
  - JUnit 5, AssertK, MockK, and Testcontainers for integration tests.
  - Use class fixtures from the dedicated `testFixtures` source set (organized by layer: domain, API, infrastructure).
  - Use `lateinit var` for top-level test variables and initialize them in a `@BeforeTest` function.
  - Structure test methods into three distinct blocks (Given, When, Then) separated by blank lines, without explicit
    comments.
  - Try to make only one assertion per test method, unless multiple assertions are logically related.
  - Use static imports for assertions, fixtures, and common utilities to improve code readability.
  - Integration tests should extend `AbstractIntegrationTest` or `AbstractEndpointIntegrationTest` (located in `backend/src/integrationTest/kotlin/me/elgregos/theweddingplan/`) to inherit Testcontainers PostgreSQL setup with reusable containers.
- **Coding Style**: For Kotlin development, adopt idiomatic Kotlin best practices: use concise syntax, favor functional
  style, and avoid verbose Java-like patterns. Specifically, use one-line functions with `=` whenever possible. The build enforces strict null-safety with the `-Xjsr305=strict` compiler option.

### Fixture usage (project convention)

- Prefer using shared fixtures from the `testFixtures` source set instead of creating test data inline in tests. This keeps tests consistent and simplifies updates to test data.
- Use static imports for fixtures (e.g. `import me.elgregos.theweddingplan.domain.guest.GuestFixtures.janeDoe`) so test code reads clearly.
- When you need new test data, add it to the appropriate fixtures file (domain, API, infrastructure) and update tests to reuse it.


## Frontend

- All frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory.
- Frontend contains two Vite apps with separate HTML entries: `frontend/public/index.html` and `frontend/backoffice/index.html`.
- **Technologies**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, Tailwind CSS (with Vite plugin), Vue Test Utils.
- **Build & Test Commands**:
  - Install dependencies: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm install`
  - Run public app in development: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm run dev:public`
  - Run backoffice app in development: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm run dev:backoffice`
  - For each frontend issue, bump the app version before staging changes: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm run version:issue`
  - Run tests: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm run test`
  - Run tests in watch mode: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm run test:watch`
  - Run tests with coverage: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm run test:coverage`
  - Vitest currently includes `backoffice/src/**/*.spec.ts` (see `frontend/vite.config.ts`).
- if pnpm or node is not found :
  - Use `pnpm` from this absolute path: `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm`.
  - Use `node` from this absolute path: `/Users/grego/.local/state/fnm_multishells/4700_1781734884722/bin/node`
